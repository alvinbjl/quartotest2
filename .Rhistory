Education is the cornerstone of social and economic development, recognized globally for its transformative impact. The importance of education is underscored by Sustainable Development Goal 4, which advocates for inclusive and equitable quality education for all [@UNGA2015transform]. Similarly, Brunei Darussalamâ€™s national vision, Wawasan Brunei 2035, prioritizes education as a fundamental driver of its development goals \cite{GovernmentBruneiNDwawasan}. One critical factor in effective education is accessibility, which has spurred interest in understanding the spatial distribution of educational facilities.
